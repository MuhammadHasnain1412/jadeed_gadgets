## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

The app has been added to `INSTALLED_APPS` and migrations have been created. If you need to re-run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations price_comparison
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Required Dependencies

Install additional required packages:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

**Note**: You'll also need ChromeDriver for web scraping:
1. Download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
2. Place it in your system PATH or project directory
3. Update the path in scraper commands if needed

### 3. URL Configuration

The price comparison URLs have been added to your main `urls.py`:
```python
path('price-comparison/', include('price_comparison.urls')),
```

### 4. Access Controls

The `seller_required` decorator has been added to `accounts/decorators.py` to restrict access to sellers only.

## 📊 How It Works

### Automatic Product Comparison

1. **When a seller adds/updates a product**: Django signals automatically trigger price comparison
2. **Product Matching**: The system uses text similarity algorithms to find matching products from competitors
3. **Price Calculation**: Calculates price differences and determines competitive status
4. **Storage**: Results are stored in the `ProductComparison` model

### Web Scraping

1. **Scheduled Scraping**: Run scrapers periodically to get latest competitor prices
2. **Data Storage**: Competitor products are stored in `CompetitorProduct` model
3. **Price History**: Track price changes over time in `PriceHistory` model
4. **Logging**: All scraping activities are logged in `ScrapingLog` model

### Smart Matching Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that:
- Cleans and normalizes product names
- Removes common stop words (laptop, computer, etc.)
- Calculates text similarity using sequence matching
- Considers word overlap for better accuracy
- Sets confidence thresholds to avoid false matches

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### For Sellers:

1. **Access Dashboard**: Navigate to `/price-comparison/` (seller login required)
2. **View Insights**: See total products, competitive count, pricing status
3. **Product List**: View detailed comparisons at `/price-comparison/products/`
4. **Refresh Comparisons**: Use the "Refresh All Comparisons" button to update prices

### For Administrators:

1. **Run Scrapers**:
   ```bash
   # Scrape Asif Computers
   python manage.py scrape_asif
   
   # Scrape PakLap
   python manage.py scrape_paklap
   
   # Run all scrapers and update comparisons
   python manage.py run_all_scrapers
   ```

2. **Admin Interface**: Access competitor data and logs via Django admin at `/admin/`

3. **Set up Cron Jobs** (for production):
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab (runs every 6 hours)
   0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py run_all_scrapers
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Scraping Settings

You can modify scraping behavior in the management commands:

- **Max clicks for Asif scraper**: Change `max_clicks` in `scrape_asif.py`
- **Scroll attempts for PakLap**: Modify scroll range in `scrape_paklap.py`
- **Headless mode**: Remove `--headless` argument for debugging

### Matching Sensitivity

Adjust matching sensitivity in `services.py`:

```python
class PriceComparisonService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_confidence = 0.3  # Adjust this value (0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Price Difference Thresholds

Modify competitive thresholds in various places:
- Views: Look for `100` and `-100` values
- Templates: Update badge logic
- Services: Adjust `get_price_insights` method

## 📈 Dashboard Features

### Main Dashboard (`/price-comparison/`)
- **Insights Cards**: Total products, competitive count, overpriced/underpriced counts
- **Recent Comparisons Table**: Latest 10 product comparisons with status indicators
- **Recent Scraping Logs**: Shows last scraping activities
- **Refresh All Button**: Updates all comparisons with AJAX

### Product List (`/price-comparison/products/`)
- **Filtering**: By product name, category, and competitive status
- **Pagination**: Handles large product catalogs
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for pricing status
- **Detailed Views**: Link to individual product comparison details

## 🎨 Styling

The templates use Bootstrap 4 classes and include custom CSS for:
- Gradient insight cards
- Color-coded price differences (red for higher, green for lower)
- Status badges with appropriate colors
- Responsive table design

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only sellers can access price comparison features
- **CSRF Protection**: All AJAX requests include CSRF tokens
- **Input Validation**: Form inputs are properly validated
- **Rate Limiting**: Scrapers include delays to avoid being blocked

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ChromeDriver Error**:
   - Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and in PATH
   - Check Chrome browser version compatibility

2. **No Matches Found**:
   - Lower the `min_confidence` threshold in services.py
   - Check if competitor data exists in the database
   - Verify product names are descriptive enough

3. **Scraping Fails**:
   - Websites may have changed their structure
   - Update CSS selectors in scraper commands
   - Check for anti-bot measures

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Add database indexes if needed
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Optimize matching algorithms

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:

1. **Email Alerts**: Notify sellers when competitor prices change significantly
2. **Price History Charts**: Visual representation of price trends
3. **More Competitors**: Add scrapers for additional websites
4. **API Integration**: Connect with competitor APIs where available
5. **Machine Learning**: Improve matching accuracy with ML models
6. **Mobile App**: Create mobile interface for price monitoring

### Production Deployment:

1. Set up regular cron jobs for scraping
2. Configure proper logging and monitoring
3. Implement error alerting for failed scrapers
4. Add database backups for competitor data
5. Set up CDN for static files
6. Configure proper SSL certificates

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Django logs for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure database migrations are applied
4. Test with a small set of products first
5. Check that competitor websites are accessible
